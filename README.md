# multimodalAgent

First demo of an agent which can take data from an input table, an perform actions required by employees: such as 
- Plotting two axes of data against each other
- Displaying the distribution of a column of data
- Displaying a row of anomalies for a column with a given z-score threshold
- return x columns with highest correlation with a column of the employee's choosing

Future tools include:
- Tools to manipulate qualitative data
- evaluation agent, which can give insights to plotted and returned data previously asked by the employee
